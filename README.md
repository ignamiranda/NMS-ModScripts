# NMS-ModScripts
My No Man's Sky mods made in AMUMSS

These mods can be built using [AMUMSS](https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/957).

All scripts that start with "BiomeMishMasher" must be used together. They don't have to built into a combined PAK but they all reference each other and will crash if you don't have all of the scripts installed in some way. All of these also require the included \_DynamicBiomeGenerationAssets.pak file.

The AccurateBiomeNames is a really intensive script to run and it changes something that I don't think a lot of people want so you can skip it. It basically just changes biome names like "Viridescent" and "Tropical" to just say "Lush" or their respective biome type.

You can learn from my scripts and comment on them but please don't straight up reuse or redistribute them or my mods.
