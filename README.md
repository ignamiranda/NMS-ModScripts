# NMS-ModScripts
My No Man's Sky mods made in AMUMSS

These mods can be built using [AMUMSS](https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/957).

All scripts that start with "BiomeMishMasher" must be used together. They don't have to built into a combined PAK but they all reference each other and will crash if you don't have all of the scripts installed in some way. All of these also require the included \_DynamicBiomeGenerationAssets.pak file.
